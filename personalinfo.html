Summary:

Just some guy out here trying to live in this changing world. Originally, I grew up on small farm in Missouri where I decide that I wanted to become a Vet.
Like all kids I rushed to college and like all kids I changed my major about 4 different times. I settled of being a mechanic for my love of racecars.
I finished a degree in Automotive Technology at Southeast Community College in Milford, NE. After waking up one day I realized that I hated my back being in so much pain,
so I decided to get certified as a personal trainer. I was hired at the best gym in Omaha but like all sales jobs I wasn�t paid enough.
So now I am here writing this personal information page, ready for a new adventure.
